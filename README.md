   - **Problem:** Create a program that demonstrates various array operations, including finding the maximum and minimum values, sorting, and reversing an array.

**5. Prime Number Checker:**

   - **Problem:** Implement a Java program that checks whether a given number is prime or not. Allow users to input a number and display the result.

**6. Palindrome Checker:**

   - **Problem:** Write a program that determines if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward) without using built-in reverse functions.

**7. File Reader and Writer:**

   - **Problem:** Create a Java program that reads data from one text file and writes it to another file. Allow users to specify the input and output file names.

**8. Matrix Operations:**

   - **Problem:** Implement a program that performs common matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Allow users to input two matrices and display the result.
